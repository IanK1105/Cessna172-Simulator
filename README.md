# Cessna172-Simulator
This is my Java-based flight simulator inspired by the Cessna 172 to practice and expand on the coding skills I am learning in APCSA, while throuroughly integrating basic flight physics and real-world aerodynamics. My goal is to create a fun, educational simulator that models realistic flight behavior. It's a work in progress as I keep learning and adding new features.

Began on the project this week (using intelliJ as my code window), setting up essential state and aircraft variables and incorporating environmental conditions and basic physics. I quickly realized that my initial plan risked poor real life accuracy, so I remodeled the code to be more extensible for future enhancements. Currently, I am struggling with tuning drag and lift to model stall behavior realistically. I've completed about 40% of the basics of flight. I aim to accurately model flight characteristics under various scenarios and environmental conditions. 

Next step: Complete the core physics module to establish foundational flight dynamics.
