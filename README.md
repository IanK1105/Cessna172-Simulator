# Cessna172-Simulator
This is my Java-based flight simulator inspired by the Cessna 172 to practice and expand on the coding skills I am learning in APCSA, while throuroughly integrating basic flight physics and real-world aerodynamics. My goal is to create a fun, educational simulator that models realistic flight behavior. It's a work in progress as I keep learning and adding new features.
